# Usage

### Example of providing a PR ID to fetch & subsequently use the branch name

```yaml
- name: Get branch name based on PR ID
  uses: bahmutov/get-branch-name-by-pr@v1
  id: pr_data
  with:
    repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pr-id: 123

- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ steps.pr_data.outputs.branch }}
```

### Example where the action just takes the PR ID from context

```yaml
- name: Get branch name based on PR
  uses: bahmutov/get-branch-name-by-pr@v1
  id: pr_data
  with:
    repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    ref: ${{ steps.pr_data.outputs.branch }}
```
